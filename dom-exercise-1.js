/*
Create and link a JavaScript file. 

Create a function named “main”. The HTML is already set up to
call this function when the “Action!!!” button is clicked.
Within the main function:
● Add the "big" class to the "grow-me" paragraph.
● Remove the "big" class to the "shrink-me" paragraph.
● Find all the <li>s and log their text content to the console.
● Set the href of the link to "https://www.example.com" and update the text to say
"somewhere" instead of "nowhere".
● Set the "display" CSS property of the "hide-me" paragraph to "none".
● Set the "display" CSS property of the "show-me" paragraph to "block".
● Get the text that the user enters into the "name" input box and use it to set a welcome
message in the <h1>, e.g., "Hello Grant!".
